October 2025: Version 3.3 Released!

XFMC v3.3 introduces a fully integrated, dedicated Autopilot (AP) module — eliminating the long-standing compatibility issues with the native X-Plane autopilot.
XFMC now functions as a combined FMC + AP system, providing consistent and precise flight-path control across all supported aircraft.

✈️ Key Improvements

Integrated XFMC Autopilot:
The new internal AP handles LNAV, VNAV, ILS, and flare logic independently from X-Plane’s native systems, ensuring smooth and predictable behavior even on aircraft with custom logic (e.g. x737).

Configurable PID Tuning:
Each aircraft can now define its own PID control parameters in the configuration files, allowing fine-tuning of roll, pitch, yaw, and approach handling for specific flight models.

Enhanced ILS and Flare Handling:
Improved stability during final approach and touchdown, with logic refined for realistic flare altitude and pitch control.

XFMC App v1.06:
A new page has been added to the companion app, enabling real-time PID adjustments while in flight. Perfect for tuning responsiveness without restarting the sim.

⚙️ Notes

Existing configuration files will be automatically updated to include the new PID entries.

The dedicated AP operates with a 20 ms internal update rate for precise control feedback.

Backward-compatible with earlier XFMC flight plans and navigation data.
 XFMC Plugin – Version 3.3
Fixed: Vector approach now correctly handles Left/Center/Right runway arrivals.

Fixed: QNH mismatch issue where Flight Level on IVAO differed from Littlenavmap/X-Plane.

Added: Dedicated autopilot with ILS approach support.

Joystick can override steering.

XFMC generates a new config file with AP settings automatically.

PID parameters can be adjusted live via the Android AP interface (sliders).

Heading, VNAV, and altitude overrides are available on the panel.

To activate the dedicated AP, set dedicated AP = 1 in the config file.

To enable ILS approach:

Set the ILS frequency on the radio page.

Use the APP button on the approach page.

When on glideslope, APP [ACT] or APP [LOC] will appear.

Flare altitude and pitch angle can be configured.

Config files for various aircraft with dedicated AP will be provided later.

XFMC for X-Plane 12 – A Relaunch<br/>
Background<br/>
Between 2011 and 2019, XFMC was available for X-Plane 9 and 10. Development was discontinued after the release of X-Plane 11. Recently, after purchasing X-Plane 12 and finding the default FMCs somewhat limited, I decided to revive XFMC and make it fully compatible with the latest version of the simulator.<br/>
Key Improvements<br/>
The entire codebase has been rewritten and updated. Major changes include:<br/>
•	Fixes for longstanding bugs<br/>
•	Proper handling of SID and STAR restrictions<br/>
•	Approach vector plots aligned with the runway<br/>
•	Full go-around support (both clockwise and counterclockwise)<br/>
•	Added Decision Inhibit functionality<br/>
•	Completely redesigned VNAV (Vertical Navigation)<br/>
•	Network support: connect an Android tablet to use XFMC as a remote CDU (Control Display Unit) and MAP<br/>

Supported Aircraft<br/>
XFMC is compatible with a wide range of aircraft, including:<br/>
•	All G1000-equipped aircraft (e.g. Cirrus SF50, Cirrus SR22, Aerobask Phenom, Aerobask DA62, Aerobask RB401, Laminar LanceAir, PiperAeroJet)<br/>
•	Default Laminar aircraft (B738, A333, MD82, Cessna X)<br/>
•	Zibo 4K<br/>
•	X737 by Benedikt Stratmann<br/>
Navigation Data<br/>
XFMC uses the Navigraph database, which provides SID/STAR and airport data. Without Navigraph, XFMC will fall back to X-Plane’s internal database (note: this does not include SID/STAR). To disable Navigraph support, open XFMC.ini and set: <br/>
EXTNAVPRIORITY=0<br/>
Package Contents<br/>
•	Full documentation<br/>
•	Quick setup guide for Android tablets<br/>
•	Configuration files for different aircraft<br/>
•	Installer/Updater tool<br/>
Installation Guide<br/>
1.	Unzip the installer to a dedicated folder.<br/>
2.	Run the installer and point it to your X-Plane 12 directory. Click Save.<br/>
3.	<br/>  
4.	Restart the installer if necessary and select Install XFMC.<br/>
5.	Wait until the message files unpacked appears (installation time depends on internet speed).
Updating<br/>
•	Launch the installer.<br/>
•	The server release version (e.g. 3.26) and your local XFMC.ini version will be displayed.<br/>
•	If they do not match, an Update button will appear.<br/>
•	Click it to download the latest win.xpl and place it in /plugins/XFMC/64/.<br/><img width="200" height="100" alt="Screen Shot 08-21-25 at 01 35 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1231d1cc-29a6-4449-bf56-eb1364ed4245" />

Platform Support<br/>
•	Supported: Windows, Android tablets<br/>
•	Not supported: iOS, Linux<br/>
Configuration Notes<br/>
XFMC ships with preconfigured aircraft settings, including automation of flaps, gear, <br/>transponder, and other systems. If you prefer manual control, open the aircraft’s .ini file and set:<br/> 
CONFIG=0<br/>
Each aircraft .ini file must be placed in the same folder as the aircraft’s .acf file. For <br/>example, for the B738:    X-Plane 12/Aircraft/Laminar/B738/b738.ini<br/>
Final Notes<br/>
This is a personal, non-commercial project and will remain freeware. If you encounter bugs, please report them only if they can be reproduced consistently.<br/>
Happy flying!<br/>
✈️ Quick Setup Guide: XFMC & ATC/CTR (dedicated AP use)
🛫 Flight Preparation
📄 Load flight plan (SimBrief → XFMC import).

🛤 Select departure runway/SID.

📊 Enter cruise level in Performance page.

🛬 (Optional) Select arrival STAR.

➡️ If no ILS arrival:

Go to Approach page → click VECTORS.

XFMC builds vector approach with API, REF, THRSH points.

⚙️ Pre-Takeoff Setup
🎛 Set MCP altitude dial in aircraft.

Or type FL in command line → click MCP.

📝 On Takeoff page:

Select flaps.

Click V1, V2, REF.

🚕 Taxi to runway hold → click AP button in XFMC.

📡 If CONFIG bit 7 (128) set → transponder auto ON.

🚀 Takeoff
🛣 Line up on centerline → full throttle.

🔔 Wait for “PULL UP” prompt.

🎮 Pull joystick gently → hold until INIT-CLIMB.

✋ Release gradually → maintain positive climb.

🛫 XFMC takes over climb → respects restrictions → levels at FL.

☕ Relax, time for coffee!

📡 ATC Instructions (Enroute)
🧭 Heading change:

Disable LNAV → set heading bug.

Hack: type HEADING/XXX → click FIX.

📍 Waypoint change:

Type waypoint in command line → click first line of LEGS page.

If shortcut: deletes points between duplicate waypoints.

If far ahead: remove intermediate points to avoid illogical routing.

✈️ Cruise
🛑 Plane levels at programmed FL.

⬆️ To climb: enter new FL → click MCP.

⬇️ To descend (CTR instruction): same procedure.

🛬 Arrival & Descent
📐 Check VNAV Page 3 → TOD.

🎛 Before TOD: set MCP altitude in aircraft (not XFMC MCP).

⬇️ Early descent (ATC):

Enter new FL → click MCP.

If within 60 nm of TOD → VNAV Page 3 → DESCEND NOW.

🧭 Heading/waypoint changes: same as cruise.

📡 ILS Arrival
📻 Select ILS frequency on Radio Page.

🛬 On Approach Page → click APP → becomes APP [ACT].

📏 Ensure altitude 2000–3000 ft AGL before intercept.

🔒 When APP [LOC] shows → plane on glideslope.

Set flaps.

⚡ Adjust speed via VNAV Page 3, ECON speed, or manual throttle.

🛑 Cut engines ~200 ft AGL → flare at 20–30 ft AGL.

🛞 Apply brakes/RTO after touchdown.

🛬 Non-ILS Arrival
➡️ Use vector approach or program arrival plan.

⚡ Adjust approach speed in VNAV Page 3 (e.g., ECON 250 → ~200).

🧭 Vector approach aligns runway, but manual heading/speed may be needed.

✋ Flare pitch-up must be done manually (not automatic).
